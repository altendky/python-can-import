History and Roadmap
===================

Background
----------

Dynamic Controls has been using and maintaining this library since 2009.
Originally written by Ben Powell as a thin wrapper around the Kvaser SDK
to support the leaf device. Maintenance was taken over by Brian Thorne in
2010.

Original support for linux socketcan was added by Rose Lu as a summer coding
project in 2011.

The socketcan interface was helped immensely by Phil Dixon who wrote a 
leaf-socketcan driver for Linux.


Python 3
--------

The Python 'socket' module contains support for SocketCAN in version 3.3.
This library started targeting Python 3 as it was released as open source
in 2013.

BCM
----

From Python 3.4 BCM is natively supported so this will be integrated when
Python 3.4 is more widespread.
