History and Roadmap
===================

Background
----------

Dynamic Controls has been using and maintaning this library since 2009.
Originally written by Ben Powell as a thin wrapper around the Kvaser SDK
to support the leaf device. Support for linux socketcan was added by Rose
Lu as a summer coding project in 2011.

The socketcan interface was helped immensely by Phil Dixon who wrote a 
leaf-socketcan driver for Linux.


Python 3
--------

The Python 'socket' module contains support for SocketCAN in version 3.3.
