CAN Interface Modules
---------------------

Found under ``can.interfaces`` are the implementations for each backend:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    socketcan_ctypes
    socketcan_native
    kvaser
    serial

These interfaces define the low level interface to the physical controller area network.
